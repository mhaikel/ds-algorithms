1. Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.
   For example:
   Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
   Follow up:
   Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

2. Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.
   You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.
